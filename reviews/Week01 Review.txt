Staticaly Type Programming Languages: Java, C#, TypeScript, C++

        int variableName;

        Compiler ====> during the compile time


Dynamicly Type Programming Languages: JavaScript, Python

        let variableName;

        Interperter ====> during the runtimew time



Promises: Future value/error (50/50)


----------------------------------------

Task01: 
        Make a promise to return the value 
        Step1
        Step2
        Step3
        Step4
        Step5 

Task02:
        Step1
        Step2
        Step3 (need the value of Task01 returning) await for the promised value
        Step4

Task03:
        Step1
        Step2 (need the value of Task01 returning) await for the promised value
        Step3 
        Step4

Task04:
        Step1
        Step2
        Step3 (need the value of Task01 returning) await for the promised value

Word Break Problem
Given an input string and a dictionary of words, find out if the input string can be segmented
into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words. See following examples for more details.
This is a famous Google interview question, also being asked by many other companies now a days.
Consider the following dictionary
	{ i, like, sam, sung, samsung, mobile, ice, cream, icecream, man, go, mango}
	Input:  ilike
	Output: Yes
	The string can be segmented as "i like".

	Input:  ilikesamsung
	Output: Yes
	The string can be segmented as "i like samsung" or "i like sam sung".

Create a function that can Count of substrings having all distinct characters
        Given a string str consisting of lowercase alphabets, the task is to find the number of possible substrings (not necessarily distinct) that consists of distinct characters only.
            Examples:
                Input: Str = “gffg”
                Output: 6
        Explanation:
            All possible substrings from the given string are,
            ( “g“, “gf“, “gff”, “gffg”, “f“, “ff”, “ffg”, “f“, “fg“, “g” )
            Among them, the highlighted ones ( “g“, “gf“, “f“, “f“, “fg“, “g” ) consists of distinct characters only.

                Input: str = “gfg”
                Output: 5
        Explanation:
            All possible substrings from the given string are,
            ( “g“, “gf“, “gfg”, “f“, “fg“, “g” )
            Among them, the highlighted ( “g“, “gf“, “f“, “fg“, “g” ) consists of distinct characters only.

Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix  is shown below:
        1 2 3
        4 5 6
        9 8 9

    Output:
        The absolute difference is: 2

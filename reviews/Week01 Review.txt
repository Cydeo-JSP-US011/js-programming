Word Break Problem
Given an input string and a dictionary of words, find out if the input string can be segmented
into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words. See following examples for more details.
This is a famous Google interview question, also being asked by many other companies now a days.
Consider the following dictionary
	{ i, like, sam, sung, samsung, mobile, ice, cream, icecream, man, go, mango}
	Input:  ilike
	Output: Yes
	The string can be segmented as "i like".

	Input:  ilikesamsung
	Output: Yes
	The string can be segmented as "i like samsung" or "i like sam sung".

Create a function that can Count of substrings having all distinct characters
        Given a string str consisting of lowercase alphabets, the task is to find the number of possible substrings (not necessarily distinct) that consists of distinct characters only.
            Examples:
                Input: Str = “gffg”
                Output: 6
        Explanation:
            All possible substrings from the given string are,
            ( “g“, “gf“, “gff”, “gffg”, “f“, “ff”, “ffg”, “f“, “fg“, “g” )
            Among them, the highlighted ones ( “g“, “gf“, “f“, “f“, “fg“, “g” ) consists of distinct characters only.

                Input: str = “gfg”
                Output: 5
        Explanation:
            All possible substrings from the given string are,
            ( “g“, “gf“, “gfg”, “f“, “fg“, “g” )
            Among them, the highlighted ( “g“, “gf“, “f“, “fg“, “g” ) consists of distinct characters only.
